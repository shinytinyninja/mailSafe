# Project Title

MailSafe - A Hack Western 8 Project and Winner of the Entrepreneurialship award from the 1517 Fund!

## Description

Our inital goal was to create a tool to notify users of in-browser expension to notify users of spam and phishing attempts. We settled on creating a Chrome Web Extension that would read the sender addresses of incoming emails and compare them against a vetted database.
  
### Installing

Installation can done through Chrome Web tools developer mode. Although since the writing of this readMe, chrome has updated their security features and limits the reach of Web Extensions.
